# Quest Board

*For that fuzzy RPG feeling.*

**NOTE: This mod is heavy WIP. There are currently no public binaries.** Feel free to build it for yourself and try it out, though.

## Features

* Different categories of quests
    * **Gather** - Gather a certain amount of specified resources and return them back to the board.
    * **Travel** - Travel to a specific location. Once there, the quest will complete.
    * **Retrieve** - Retrieve an object and return it back to the board.
    * **Slay** - Slay a given amount of a specified monster and return back to the board.
* Villages have a chance to generate with a "Quest Board" somewhere in them. 
    * These generate a random set of quests from the quest pool for the player to take on.
    * Once all generated quests have been completed, the board will regenerate a new set after some time.
* Full quest creation support both through code and JSON configs.
